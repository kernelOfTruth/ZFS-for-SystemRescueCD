ABOUT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ZFS kernel modules provided within this repository (SRM files)
add up-to-date support to SystemRescueCD for accessing current ZFS pools
(by courtesy of the ZFSonLinux and OpenZFS project).

Since some of us are running bleeding-edge, upgraded upstream 
zpools, with the usually provided ZFS support in the liveCDs 
and live-media (v0.6.2, and especially v0.6.3 & v0.6.4+) access isn't easily 
possible to the stored data, which can be quite troubling in case 
of emergencies.

With the introduction of the SRM (System-Rescue-Modules) it is quite
easy to add additional programs or kernel modules - therefore the
emergence of this project.



CONTENT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the following things:

- Bliss Initramfs Creator - v1.8.1 (bliss-initramfs/1.8.1)

- Kernel Configuration of SysRescCD 4.3.0 kernels (slightly modified to succeed build; kernel-config/config-amd64-*)

- up-to-date ZFS SRM modules for SysRescCD 4.5.2 (spl, zfs-kmod, zfs), as of April 10th to 11th (CEST) 2015
  (SRM-modules/4.5.2)


SRM-Modules
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Info about the kernel modules:

Toolchain was: Binutils 2.23.2, GCC Hardened 4.8.4 p1.3, pie-0.6.1 (very similar to SystemRescueCD)

CFLAGS: -march=x86-64 -mtune=generic


HOWTO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- when using SystemRescueCD 4.5.2 on an USB stick - everything needed to do is
 
- follow the instructions from http://www.sysresccd.org/Sysresccd-manual-en_How_to_install_SystemRescueCd_on_an_USB-stick

- have the usbstick mounted (mount -t vfat /dev/sdf1 /mnt/usbstick)

- then copy over the zfs-core and zfs-kmod SRM files to the root of the usbstick(zfs-core-3.14.35-std452-amd64.srm, 
  zfs-core-3.18.10-alt452-amd64.srm, zfs-kmod-3.14.35-std452-amd64.srm, zfs-kmod-3.18.10-alt452-amd64.srm)
  
- make sure that the usbstick is bootable, otherwise rewrite syslinux to the device (e.g. syslinux /dev/sdf1 && sync)

- ...

- during boot choose the 64bit versions (both default and alternative are supported), pick your keymap configuration

- after boot has finished run 'depmod'

- then a simple 'modprobe zfs' should be enough

- check state and version of zfs with 'zpool upgrade -v'

- Enjoy !

This script generates an initramfs image with all the included files and 
dependencies needed to mount your zpool.

You will need a few programs already installed on your computer since this 
script just automates the process of you actually going into your filesystem,
and getting all those files.

Please have the following installed:

- Linux Kernel
  ZLIB_INFLATE/DEFLATE must be compiled into the kernel (not as a module).
  > ZLIB_INFLATE [=y], ZLIB_DEFLATE [=y]
  
  General setup --->
  > [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
  > () Initramfs source file(s)

  Device Drivers --->
  > Generic Driver Options --->
  >> [*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev
  >> [*] Automount devtmpfs at /dev, after the kernel mounted the rootfs

  # Only if you want to make an SRM
  > File systems --->
  >> Miscellaneous filesystems --->
  >>> <*> SquashFS 4.0 - Squashed file system support
  >>> [*] Squashfs XATTR support
  >>> [*] Include support for ZLIB compressed file systems
  >>> [*] Include support for LZO compressed file systems
  >>> [*] Include support for XZ compressed file systems

  * All other drivers required to see your PATA/SATA drives must be compiled in.
